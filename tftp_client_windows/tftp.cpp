SUBJECT : TFTP client.
AUTHOR  : (C) Copyright 2010 by Peter C. Chapin

This is a simple TFTP client that uses Winsock. It allows the user to interactively get files
(for which the user knows the name).

This version does not timeout the recvfrom() calls. It can mostly get away with this because the
server will resend the last data block if it doesn't get the ACK from this program. There are
three situations where the lack of a timeout here will cause a problem. All three of them are
somewhat rare:

 1. The initial RRQ packet sent by this program is lost on the network.
 2. The server crashes or becomes unreachable during a transfer.
 3. All server retries are lost and the server gives up.
 
A more robust version of this program would timeout recvfrom() but this program should work
fairly well without it, even in cases where data is lost on the network. Here I'm assuming that
the server implemenation is robust.

This version also does not worry much about duplicate packets. It is careful to only save new
packets (duplicates are not saved) but it ACKs all packets it receives regardless. In a vast
majority of cases the only duplicate packet you might see would be the previous one. Such
packets would be sent as a result of a server retry after a lost ACK. In that case, ACKing the
packet is the correct (and necessary) thing to do. However, the server will not send a new
packet until it has gotten a positive acknowledgement for the current one. Thus the server
should never resend arbitrarly old packets. Such packets *might* wander on the network and
arrive here at the client long after they were sent. In that case the client should not ACK them
(they must have already been resent by the server and ACKed by the client if they are that old),
although doing so shouldn't cause an error.

To Do:

 + Allow the program to accept the filename(s) on the command line so that it is more easily
   scriptable.
   
 + Support optional numeric IP addresses in place of host names.
 
 + Implement some more interactive commands (such as a command that allows the user to change
   hosts and/or ports). This will require changing the prompt and introducing a formal "get"
   command as well.
   
 + Deal with timeouts while waiting for packets from the server.
 
 + This version of the program won't allow transfers of files greater than 32 MBytes because of
   the way block numbers wrap around after that. This should be fixed (how do servers handle the
   wrap-around?). Currently such large files are SILENTLY truncated. Bad. This program thinks
   the low numbered blocks are duplicates of previously seen blocks. It thus does not write them
   to disk.
